This Python code creates a **Symbol Recognizer** app using **Streamlit**, which allows users to classify symbols or simple images using **Logistic Regression** or **Naive Bayes** classifiers. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its components:

- **Libraries used**: The app uses popular data science libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `altair` to handle data, create visualizations, and build machine learning models. Streamlit is used to build an interactive web interface.
  
- **Functionality**:
  - Users can choose between **Logistic Regression** or **Naive Bayes** classifiers to perform symbol classification.
  - A dataset containing binary representations of symbols is loaded and displayed.
  - The app visualizes the 8x8 pixel images of the symbols from the dataset.
  - It splits the data into training and testing sets and trains the selected model.
  - A **confusion matrix** and a **classification report** (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score) are displayed to evaluate the model's performance.

- **Main Features**:
  - Interactive selection of classifiers.
  - Visualization of the dataset and the symbols.
  - Evaluation metrics for model performance, including the confusion matrix and classification report.

This app provides a simple yet effective way to demonstrate classification techniques on image data.
